                    Are you in business, politics, or a postion of responsibility? Do
                    you influence those around you in a way that improves your
                    reputation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you want to be understood and remembered? Would you like to be
                    highly respected and for people to act on what you’ve said after
                    meeting you in person. Would you like to be able to tell a
                    compelling story or give a speech that has your audience hooked?
                    Maybe your needs are a little more human and lower key…maybe you’d
                    like more confidence, to be more approachable and likeable and to
                    influence other people in a way that generates warmth, admiration
                    and connection…

                    If so, this is your opportunity to be personally coached by the
                    Founder & CEO of the foremost professional skills training company

                    For the last 20 years Nick Smallman, has been showing people all
                    over the world how to develop their Charisma, Gravitas and Presence.
                    These are the essential attributes of all highly successful people,
                    and his executive coaching will give you these skills.
                </p>
                <h5>A different coaching method</h5>
                <p>
                    A lot of executive coaching fails because the client is told what to
                    do and to replace their current methods and technique.
                    Unfortunately, human beings are creatures of habit and insecurity.
                    Usually, we all revert to old behaviours, so the new way gets lost.
                </p>
                <h5>Reorganising the mind</h5>
                <p>
                    Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and
                    communicator by using a series of psychological techniques that once
                    employed and embedded, strengthen your ability over time. Good
                    coaching is about changing your mind on a fundamental level rather
                    than showing you what to do. Real growth is psychological. The
                    physical will follow. He will teach you techniques not by telling
                    you what to do but instead by giving you solutions that embed
                    themselves in your thinking. Over time, many of the things you
                    thought were beyond possibility become easy and natural.
